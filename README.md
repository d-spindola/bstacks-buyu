# Bun (web blessed) runtime

I've been using Bun for all my JS/TS personal projects for the last 4 months and no one will stop me.

This repo is an "blankdir" template, contains only the expected output for me to start develop from hello world to real world.

Quickly get started with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) using this starter! Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime with a focus on speed.

- This starter starts a Bun HTTP server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- You can check [http.ts](./http.ts) to see how the server is started.
- If you want to upgrade Bun, you can change `BUN_VERSION` in the [Dockerfile](./.codesandbox/Dockerfile).
